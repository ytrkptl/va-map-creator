# va-map-creator (Virginia Map Creator)

Virginia map creator that uses Rough.js. Tweak around with the options using the Settings pane and then download the map to your device as an SVG file (so far only tested on computers). Default options are set to Virginia Tech colors.

Here is a screenshot with the default settings pane. All settings can be modified and include a button to download the SVG file as well as a "Reset" button to reset the map to default settings.
